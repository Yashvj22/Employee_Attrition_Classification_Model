# Employee Attrition Prediction

This project predicts **employee attrition** based on various workplace and personal factors. The model is built using **Machine Learning** techniques and deployed as an interactive **Streamlit app**.  

## ðŸš€ Features  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing key factors influencing employee attrition.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Created meaningful features using **Best-fit Random Forest**.  
- **Model Building**: Implemented **Voting Classifier, Bagging Classifier, and Random Forest**.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Used **Optuna** to optimize model performance.  
- **Employee Attrition Prediction App**: Users can input details and get real-time predictions.    

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Use  

1. Open the **Streamlit App** (link below).  
2. Enter the required input details about an employee.  
3. Click **Predict Attrition** to see whether the employee is likely to stay or leave.
